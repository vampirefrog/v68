v68
===

A Human68k X68000 CUI emulator. Very similar to [run68](https://github.com/rururutan/run68), it is written from scratch and emulates, besides the OS calls and the CPU, the sound hardware.

Uses [Musashi](https://github.com/kstenerud/Musashi) for CPU emulation.

In the [docs](docs) folder, there are some partially translated versions of [puni](https://nfggames.com/X68000/index.php/Mirrors/Groundzero%20Organization/x68tools/develop/docs/puni/) docs.
